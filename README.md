  <summary>ReaBooster</summary>
  This is a fun web game where you have to click the targets as fast as possible. It registers your reaction time and score. I did this with HTML and CSS for the looks and JavaScript for the functions and interaction. I made the base of this in a course called 'The complete web developer course 2.0' on udemy and added some extra features and styles by myself.

  - I found a great challenge. I had to read a file and display the amount of lines in the file. I succesfully completed this challenge and started the 'Advanced C Programming' course.
