      <summary>C</summary>
      I started this language with a course called "Learning C" on LinkedIn learning. I have completed this course and got a certificate which is in this repository. I am currently working on Advanced C Programming which is the second of the 3 courses in my C learning path. I don't plan on using this language but it is a good base of a lot of programming languages.
