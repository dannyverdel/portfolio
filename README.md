## Projects
Below I have listed some of my projects I have been working on. For more details you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/dannyverdel/portfolio/tree/main/Projects">Projects</a> folder. 
<details>
  <summary>ReaBooster</summary>
  This is a fun web game where you have to click the targets as fast as possible. It registers your reaction time and score. I did this with HTML and CSS for the looks and JavaScript for the functions and interaction. I made the base of this in a course called 'The complete web developer course 2.0' on udemy and added some extra features and styles by myself.

  <summary>Portfolio</summary>
  This is a self made website which is quite similair to this portfolio. But this is to display my HTML and CSS skills too. I made this as an assignment for school.
